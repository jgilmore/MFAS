Credit goes to Mendoza for intial V2 script.

To run from turtleOS:
pastebin get KqR95e8A MFAS
MAKE SURE TO LABEL YOUR TURTLE. Really, saves a ton of time: label set "MFAS"

Major changes from V2.
    
Partial list of new features:
    Goes around fluids (waterfall in multi-level farm)
    Chests are also considered walls
    Replants even if it didn't harvest (configurable)
    No longer prompts for fuel chest location if turtle fuel is unlimited
    No longer harvests the base of the reeds
    Mod specific crop harvesting is now easier to add later
    No longer digs up base minecraft non-crop items (half slabs over your water source, anyone?)
    Command line options are now supported (menu,reset,RESET)
    Now creates a "startup" file so is automatically restarted when you replace it, or reload the world.
    Maybe more, I forget.

Known bugs:
	Doesn't handle wide water columns gracefully. At all.
	Doesn't handle magical crops (probably, untested)
	Doesn't handle other mods unless specifically told to (but easy to add them)
	Doesn't automatically generate a label for your turtle if you didn't already label it. (It probably should)
	Requires dirt or farmland at the edge for multi-floor farms (zivico farmland etc not supported, yet)

Probably many more bugs to.
